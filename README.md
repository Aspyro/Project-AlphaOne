# Description

Are you bored to play vanilla Minecraft ?
So now you want to try out modded Minecraft ?
But you still want to keep the vanilla feeling ?
Then **THIS** is the perfect starter modpack !


This pack wants to upgrade the vanilla content in multiple ways :
- Upgrade your storage possibilities with Iron Chests, Iron Shulker Boxes and Metal Barrels mods !
- Meet new mobs with Infernal Expansion and some other similar mods !
- Meet new animals with More Living Things and rediscover vanilla mobs with Better Animal Models !
- Get in a new ambiance with Dynamic Surroundings !
- Fill in the block gap from vanilla Minecraft with Absent by Design ! (Hi brick and sandstone walls !)
- And so much more quality of life elements like the possibility to edit signs (Edit sign mod) or the power to gain health or boosts when eating a lot of different foods (thanks to Spice of Life: Carrot Edition and Spice of Life: Potato Edition) !

... And way more new things to come in the next updates like maybe a new dimension and a new boss or new ores to get a more powerful stuff !

So, if you're interested, stay tuned !

(This modpack being in early stages of development, keep in mind that a lot can change !)
